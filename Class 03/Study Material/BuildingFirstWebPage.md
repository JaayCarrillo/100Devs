# How to set up a HTML5 Document Structure 
Depending on your IDE there are often short cuts that can do this for you. If using VSCode type "! then enter" and it should auto populate the document structure

## Steps to set up your Document Structure
1. document will be saved as an .html file extension rather than a .txt or any other extension 
2. plain text editors will need to be used to begin - there are many out there but these are just a few ex. VSCode, Notepad+, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDea etc. 
3. Must have these declarations: 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>
Example: 
```
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Doc Set Up</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>This is a markdown page of things you need to set up your first web page.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
